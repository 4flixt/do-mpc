    "## Intro\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook we will have a look at setting up and running an example of a **do-mpc** configuration in a real-time environment, which mimics closely the reality encountered in the real world, be it in a lab setup or an industriyl application. The simulator will act as a stand-alone plant which, once started, runs continuously in the background. The MPC controller must have a means of communicating to the plant and sending it optimal inputs at certain time intervals. Additionally, the state of a real plant can rarely, if at all, be fully measured. Therefore a state estimator is typically used and this, too, will require to access plant measurements and provide the estimated state vector to the controller with a certain frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous paragraph briefly describes the real-time scenario that we will be implementing. One way of realizing it is to use a distributed, asynchronous and parallel software implementation. The communication between the MPC modules can be implemented using the classical client-server paradigm of software solutions. To be as close as possible to real, industrial applications, we have opted in **do-mpc** for an OPC UA solution which fulfills all requirements and has the benefit of being very relatable for practitioners from the process systems industry and not only. You can read more about FreeOPCUA at their [webpage](https://python-opcua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that all of this is very easy to do in Python. All you need to do is to go to this repository and read the instructions for installing this free Python OPCUA library. While you're there, go ahead and also get their sample GUI Client, which will be very useful later on for inspecting the workings of your real-time solution. That's it! \n",

    "The following diagram illustrates what you've just read above. It shows the main MPC modules and the way data is exchanged between them via the OPCUA server, in the middle. It is important to mention that each module has its own OPCUA client, embedded away in its core. The data exchange is managed behind the curtains by **do-mpc**, such that each module reads onyl teh relevant data from the server and, conversly, only writes the meaningful stuff back on. For example the simulator only needs to read the latest available inputs. It also only writes the current measured outputs and, for debugging purposes, certain model parameters. \n",

This will cause the module(s) to stop after finishing their current iteration. \n",

    "You should notice that the real-time solution exhibits small oscillations, which become visible after t=0.2 h, when the adiabatic temperature hits the upper soft constraint. This is normal, although counterintuitive at first. After all, you can see that the simulated time solution 1) does not exhibit such a behavior. For the long answer to this, please consider reading our paper.\n",

    "Here is the short answer: the asynchronous execution introduces implicit time delays, which, especially at the limit of feasibility, become quite important. They can cause the solution of the optimization to oscillate or even crash. This is to be expected, if we think back and realize the optimizer always computes optimal inputs for a past state of the plant. By the time the inputs are updated, say after 10 seconds, the real plant has already evolved past this point, making the inputs suboptimal at the new state of the plant. Further delays can be introduced by the estimator, which interlaces itself in-between the plant and the controller.\n",
